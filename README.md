## Introduction
Don't leave your recipes lying around on pieces of paper. Having trouble finding that secret family recipe or your favorite meal? Keep your recipes stashed in this digital drawer! You can even plan your meals for the week.No more wasting time thinking of what to cook!

Stash was created to showcase my full stack abilities. The inspiration came from the need to look for recipe notes scattered in my phone, different cookbooks, and index cards stord in separate places.
